## Lesson 378 validation

- Reference: `0563-reference.png`
- Current capture: `0563-desktop.png`
- Canvas-only capture: `0563-canvas.png`
- Machine-readable interaction and layout audit: `0563-dedicated-target-validation.json`
- The capture harness verifies the target `P=(3,2,4)` state and `sqrt(29) ~= 5.39` distance, synchronized coordinate edits to `Q=(-2,3,1)`, projection-plane visibility, a physical OrbitControls gesture with changed canvas pixels, nonblank canvas evidence with 25,594 colored sample pixels and 1,505 distinct colors, correctly graded z-coordinate challenge, fullscreen toggle, tabs, shell reset, exact 1002 x 1569 dimensions, and absence of overflow or application console errors.
